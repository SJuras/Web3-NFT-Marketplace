              Welcome to Nftrafficker!, owned and operated by Sarif-Design, Nftrafficker! (“Nftrafficker!,” “we,” “us”, or “our”).
               These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Nftrafficker! website(s),
               our APIs, mobile app (the “App”), and any other software, tools, features, or functionalities
               provided on or in connection with our services; including without limitation using our services
               to view, explore, and create NFTs and use our tools, at your own discretion, to connect directly
               with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the “Service”).
               “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a
               blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or
               otherwise be associated with certain content or data.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” means you as the user
              of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity then
              “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an
              authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these
              Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.

            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION
              AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY
              ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE
              ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A
              JUDGE OR JURY IN COURT.

            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Nftrafficker! is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or creditor.
              Nftrafficker! provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users discover and directly
              interact with each other and NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have
              custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are interacting with and we do
              not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service,
              you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Nftrafficker! is not party to any agreement between any users.
              You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy,
              and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers using
              the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality,
              or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs)
              visible on the Service.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to provide additional
              terms for specific services (and such services are deemed part of the “Service”
              hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms).
              Those additional terms and conditions, which are available
              with the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us
              if you use those services. In the event of a conflict between these
              Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific
              service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Nftrafficker! reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our
              sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable
              efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the
              Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms.
              By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the
              revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective
              as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review
              the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand
              the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.

            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Like much of web3, your blockchain address functions as your identity on Nftrafficker!.
              Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to access the
              Service. Your account on the service (“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain address.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Your Account on Nftrafficker! will be associated with your linked blockchain address
              and display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated
              with such NFTs). By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you
              are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet.
              Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Nftrafficker!, and Nftrafficker! does not
              have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer
              its contents. Nftrafficker! accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with
              your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will
              operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and
              you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone.
              If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider.
              Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are
              not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result
              of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover
              or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Service or your Account.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws
              (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws) when using the Service.
              Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Service, you represent and warrant that:
              (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo;
              and (b) you have not been identified as a Specially Designated National or placed on any
              U.S. Government list of prohibited, sanctioned, or restricted parties.
              If you access or use the Service outside the United States, you are solely responsible for
              ensuring that your access and use of the Service in such country, territory or
              jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Nftrafficker! may require you to provide additional information and documents in
              certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority,
              as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to investigate a potential
              violation of these Terms. In such cases, Nftrafficker!, in its sole discretion,
              may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Service until such
              additional information and documents are processed by Nftrafficker!.
              If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a
              request, Nftrafficker! may refuse to restore your access to the Service.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-Poppins pb-4">
              Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time
              for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of
              equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Service or other
              actions that Nftrafficker!, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.
